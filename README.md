This is my C++ coursework project in NUS MFE.

This source code demonstrates the foundation of a risk management system. It can load trades from a database, compute the price of trades, discover dynamically market dependencies and construct necessary market objects, retrieve trade life-cycling information, compute price sensitivities with respect to risk factors, analyse the impact of hypothetical market scenarios.
